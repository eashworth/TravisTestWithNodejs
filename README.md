# TravisTestWithNodejs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eashworth/TravisTestWithNodejs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eashworth/TravisTestWithNodejs)

### A simple web app built to practice setting up Travis Continuous Integration in the context of a Nodejs project.

### It uses an Express server to display a string at the root route, and uses the Mocha test framework to run a single test that compares two identical hardcoded strings.

### The app is based on the example in the tutorial "Setup Continuous Integration with Travis CI in Your Nodejs App". Many thanks to its author, Gift Egwuenu:
